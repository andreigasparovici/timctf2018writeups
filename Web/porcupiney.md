I want to mention that i've resolved the challenge BEFORE the change that has been made.

(PS: i resolve it accidentally- i wanted to do the deery one :P )

(1) I took a look on http://deery.woodlandhighschool.xyz/

(2) finding nothing, i tried to go from http to https !

(3) on the https "Connection is not secured" Panel i could see two links,  deery.woodlandhighschool.xyz and nonononono.woodlandhighschool.xyz/

(4) after searching on the https version of deery.woodlandhighschool.xyz i went to the nonononono.woodlandhighschool.xyz/ and there was the flag on the bottom of the page


```
Look away! Shush! I give you flag, you shush, ok?timctf{w00dl4nd_cr1tt3rs_s3cur3_chr1stm4s}

Flag: `timctf{w00dl4nd_cr1tt3rs_s3cur3_chr1stm4s}`
